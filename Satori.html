<h2><b><u>Story</u></b></h2>
   <div class="container2"><img class="satori2" src="Image/Satori 2.jpg" alt="HTML Tag">
   <p style="font-size:15px"; align="center"><span class="span">(Satori has got make up by Akana)</span></p>
    Satori was born in a poor nearby Asakusa. His mother died since he first born and his dad was a drunk person since Satori was 5.
    When he was 6 years old, he saw the people who in the same age as him go to school happily. He told his dad that he wanted
    to study too but something bad happened. He was got hitted and cursed by his father. His father kicked him out from the house
    and let him begged people in Asukusa for money. The money that his got from him, he took it to bought Sake. In the day that
    Satori didn't get any money, his father had cursed and hitted him really hard. By unbearable, when Satori was 10 years old,
    one night he ran away from his house quitely and he ran as far as his father couldn't find him. By a day to a day and a night
    to a night, Satori went without the direction. 3rd night was coming, Satori went without any food and water. He was super
    exhausted but suddenly, a demon appeared. He was very scared because he had no weapon and also he had no energy in his body too.
    That demon rushed him in hunger. Satori know that he would die so he closed his eyes and prepared to accept his truth. But suddenly
    a bright light was appeared in front of him. When he opened his eyes, he saw a man with yellow haori and white hair stood in front of him and
    also a demon who wanna eat him was beheaded by that man. After that, he was Unconscious. He was waking up in a house and when
    he turned his head to the left, he saw an old man sit and watch him. That old
    man is "<span class="highlight-word-color1">Sensei Jigoro</span>". after he woke up, He started training Thunder breathing with
    Sensei Jigoro. After he trained for 3 years, he mastered all 6 forms of Thunder Breathing. Once when there was a Final selection,
    Satori also joined and after 7 days he was the one among 5 people who survived and became a demon slayer corp. After
    he joined demon slayer corp, one day he had a mission to Hokkaido vilage. People say, this village was raid by lower moon 2
    name "Ryoshiki" have a power to control the soul and death body. When he arrived, He felt that this place is kinda weird
    and suddenly 2 unknown went to attack him. During he fought with them, the army of death had come with Ryoshiki in it too.
    Satori still fought with them but after a moment, he feel super exhausted. But Ryoshiki still created his army more and more.
    Satori knew that can't defeat this demon, but suddenly a strong had come behind him.  It was Wind Hashira
    "<span class="highlight-word-color6">Sanemi Shinazukawa</span>" appeared. Just a blink, Sanemi succesful beheaded Lower
    moon 2. After saw the fighting style of Wind Hashira, Satori discovered that aggression is a fast way to kill demon easily.
    After that, Satori went to Rengoku mansion to learned about breathing style. He saw that there were only 5 breathing styles that
    were original. He wondered "What about another breathing styles such as Love, flower, Insect, Sound and other. How did it
    create?". But after he was in Demon slayer corp for 10 months, he realized that the breathing styles that are out from the
    original breathing styles were derived from them like mist dirived from wind, love derived from flame etc.
    Satori wanted to create his own breathing styles too. After 1.5 years of learning, he finally created his own breathing style
    and it's called "<span style="highlight-word-color1">Light breathing</span>". It's derived from Thunder, wind andd water. After he created his own breathing,
	he learned and mastered his own breathing in 1.5 years and after he joined in demon slayer corp for 2 later, he became a <span class="highlight-word-color1">light hashira</span>.
